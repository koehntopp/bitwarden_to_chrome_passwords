# bitwarden_to_chrome_passwords

I have been using [Bitwarden] (https://www.bitwarden.com) as my password manager for quite a while now, and I can wholeheartedly recommend it. I switched from Lastpass because I found the Bitwarden UI more easy to understand (my whole family uses Bitwarden as well) and because it gace me cross-platform synchronisation of my TOTP one-time passwords.
